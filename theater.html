        <h1>Gabe does Chekhov tonight</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Uncle Vanya - Anton Chekhov</h3>
        <p>ASTROFF comes in. He has his coat on, but is without his waistcoat or
            collar, and is slightly drunk. TELEGIN follows him, carrying a guitar.
            
            ASTROFF. Play!
            
            TELEGIN. But every one is asleep.
            
            ASTROFF. Play!
            
            TELEGIN begins to play softly.
            
            ASTROFF. Are you alone here? No women about? [Sings with his arms
            akimbo.]
            
               "The hut is cold, the fire is dead;
                Where shall the master lay his head?"
            
            The thunderstorm woke me. It was a heavy shower. What time is it?
            
            VOITSKI. The devil only knows.
            
            ASTROFF. I thought I heard Helena's voice.
            
            VOITSKI. She was here a moment ago.</p>
