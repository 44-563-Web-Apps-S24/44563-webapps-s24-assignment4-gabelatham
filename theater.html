        <h1>Gabe does Chekhov tonight</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Uncle Vanya - Anton Chekhov</h3>
            ASTROFF comes in. He has his coat on, but is without his waistcoat or
            collar, and is slightly drunk. TELEGIN follows him, carrying a guitar.
            
            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> <p>Play!</p>
            
            <h4>TELEGIN.</h4> <p>But every one is asleep.</p>
            
            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> <p>Play!</p>
            
            <p>TELEGIN begins to play softly.</p>
            
            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> <p>Are you alone here? No women about?</p> 
            <p>[Sings with his arms akimbo.]</p>
            
               "The hut is cold, the fire is dead;
                Where shall the master lay his head?"
            
            <p>The thunderstorm woke me. It was a heavy shower. What time is it?</p>
            
            <h4>VOITSKI.</h4> <p>The devil only knows.</p>
            
            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> <p>I thought I heard Helena's voice.</p>
            
            <h4>VOITSKI.</h4> <p>She was here a moment ago.</p>
